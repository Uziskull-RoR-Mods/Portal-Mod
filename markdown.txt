Are you a fan of the *Portal* franchise? Now you can have fun thinking with portals in *Risk of Rain*! This mod adds the **Portal Gun** as an use item, as well as a playable character - **Chell**!
This mod also adds tons of **easter eggs**... can you find them all? :^)

### **Chell**
Our wonderfully mute main character has escaped from Aperture Science, but managed to crash land in an unknown planet! Luckily, she brought along some goodies she smuggled from Aperture...

__*Long Fall Boots*__ - Wearing these at all times, *Chell* **does not suffer from fall damage**!

+ The fizzling bouncy orb is back! It might have a slow attack speed, but it makes up for it with some **powerful impact!** While it might be your main attack, remember **it can make cubes and turrets go flying** (but you wouldn't hit a turret, would you? You monster...)
+ It has a _1:25_ chance of **disintegrating its target**. If you're lucky, it might go off on a boss! Use the flag ``portal_orb_no_fizzling`` to disable this
+ Want some more challenging gameplay? Enable the ``portal_orb_friendly_fire`` flag to make the High-Energy Pellet deal damage to players as well (fair warning, if you're using the Artifact of Glass this will most likely kill you instantly)

![ability 2](https://i.imgur.com/OE8AB5a.png "Companion Cube")   __*Companion Cube*__   ![ability 2](https://i.imgur.com/OE8AB5a.png "Companion Cube")
+ Everyone's favorite sentient cube, with an added twist! The Companion Cube can be flailed around using portals (or the High-Energy Pellet), dealing damage based on **how fast it hit the target**
+ **Reactivate the ability to explode the cube**, dealing damage to all enemies around it in a lovingly explosion

![ability 3](https://i.imgur.com/cZToDKy.png "Portal Gun")   __*Portal Gun*__   ![ability 3](https://i.imgur.com/cZToDKy.png "Portal Gun")
+ A gun that makes holes, but not bullet holes! If two portals are present, you can use them to travel large distances in the blink of an eye
+ **Momentum** (otherwise known as _"speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out"_) **is conserved between portals!** Use this knowledge to fling yourself to higher ledges without having to use those pesky ropes and jump pads
    + ***Note:*** Due to the way _Risk of Rain_ applies horizontal velocity on a character, it is currently not possible to conserve momentum horizontally :'c
+ **Now multidirectional! You can shoot portals in 8 different directions** by holding down the movement keys for that angle (if you want to shoot a portal at 45º, hold Up and Right, then fire the ability)
    + ***Note:*** Risk of Rain ropes are dumb, so if you enter a portal grabbing a rope you're going to come out of the portal still grabbing it.
+ If you're playing co-op, your portal colors will be those of _Atlas_ and _P-Body_

![ability 4](https://i.imgur.com/P8VNEvs.png "Deploy Turret")   __*Deploy Turret*__   ![ability 4](https://i.imgur.com/P8VNEvs.png "Deploy Turret")
+ These bullet-filled machines are yours to command! Plop 'em down and watch them **shoot any enemy on sight** (as long as its in their sight)
+ Turrets will remain on duty for **30 seconds** (or until they're **defeated by enemies**)
    + ***Note:*** Due to the way turrets work, at the end of a level, they **will count** towards the *"Enemies remaining"* counter. With this in mind, you should destroy then (or wait for them to despawn)
+ Has the turret outlived its usefulness? Are you an evil person? Well then, go on ahead and **fling it away** using either your _High-Energy Pellets_ or your _Portal Gun_
+ Grab an *Ancient Scepter* to turn your normal turrets into Opera Turrets! These thicc bois deal double the damage and have extra HP

### **Flags (add them on your profile)**
+ ``portal_no_gun_item`` - disable the Portal Gun use item (to avoid dual wielding)
+ ``portal_orb_no_fizzling`` - High-Energy Pellets can no longer instantly kill targets
+ ``portal_orb_friendly_fire`` - High-Energy Pellets will damage allies as well (harder, but in line with the Portal series :^) )
